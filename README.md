## üîç Overview

RingFaceID adds intelligent face recognition capabilities to your Amazon Ring doorbell. When someone rings your doorbell, the system automatically:

1. **Captures** the doorbell video footage
2. **Detects** faces using MTCNN (Multi-task CNN)
3. **Recognizes** visitors using FaceNet deep learning model
4. **Announces** the visitor's name via text-to-speech

Perfect for families who want to know who's at the door before answering, especially useful for identifying family members, frequent visitors, or delivery personnel.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time Face Recognition**: Powered by FaceNet neural network for high accuracy
- **Ring Integration**: Seamless connection with Amazon Ring doorbells via official API
- **Dual Training Modes**: Collect face data from webcam or directly from Ring footage
- **Voice Announcements**: Text-to-speech notifications of recognized visitors
- **Unknown Visitor Detection**: Alerts when unrecognized faces are detected
- **Automatic Processing**: Runs continuously in the background, monitoring for doorbell events

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Deep Learning**: FaceNet (TensorFlow/Keras) for face encoding and recognition
- **Face Detection**: MTCNN for robust face detection in various conditions
- **Ring API**: Official Ring doorbell Python library for video access
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV for video processing and image manipulation
- **Audio**: gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) for voice announcements

### Model Architecture
The system uses FaceNet, a state-of-the-art face recognition model that maps face images to a compact Euclidean space where distances correspond to face similarity.

## üìã Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements
- Amazon Ring doorbell (any model with video capability)
- Computer/Raspberry Pi running 24/7 for monitoring
- Webcam (optional, for manual face data collection)
- Speakers for audio announcements

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Amazon Ring account with 2FA enabled
- Sufficient storage for face encodings and temporary video files

---

## üîß Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamuelLaki/RingFaceID.git
cd RingFaceID
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Ring Account
Set up environment variables for your Ring account:

```bash
export USERNAME="your_ring_email@example.com"
export PASSWORD="your_ring_password"
```

Or create a `.env` file:
```
USERNAME=your_ring_email@example.com
PASSWORD=your_ring_password
```

### 4. Create Required Directories
```bash
mkdir -p data/faces data/encodings
```

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Step 1: Collect Face Data

You have two options for collecting face images:

#### Option A: Using Webcam
```bash
python submit_face.py "John Doe" False
```
- A webcam window will open
- Press **SPACEBAR** to capture images from different angles
- Press **ESC** when finished
- Capture 5-10 images for best accuracy

#### Option B: From Ring Doorbell (Recommended)
```bash
python submit_face.py "John Doe" True
```
- Have the person ring your doorbell
- The system automatically extracts face images from the doorbell footage
- Higher accuracy due to real-world conditions

### Step 2: Create Face Encodings
After collecting all face data:
```bash
python create_encodings.py
```
This processes all collected images and creates the face recognition database.

### Step 3: Run the Recognition System
```bash
python main.py
```
The system will:
- Connect to your Ring doorbell
- Monitor for doorbell events
- Process each ring and announce the visitor
- Run continuously until stopped (Ctrl+C)

### Step 4: Test the System (Optional)
```bash
python test.py
```
Opens a webcam window to test face recognition in real-time.

## üîß Configuration

### Recognition Threshold
Adjust recognition sensitivity in `face_recognition.py`:
```python
recog_t = 0.4  # Lower = more strict, Higher = more lenient
```

### Frame Extraction Times
Modify which video frames to analyze in `submit_face.py`:
```python
times = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18]  # Seconds from video start
```

## üîê Security & Privacy

- **Local Processing**: All face recognition happens locally on your device
- **Encrypted Storage**: Face encodings are stored securely in pickle format
- **Ring API**: Uses official Ring API with OAuth2 authentication
- **No Cloud Dependency**: No face data is sent to external services

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors**
- Ensure Ring 2FA is enabled and working
- Check USERNAME/PASSWORD environment variables
- Delete `test_token.cache` and re-authenticate

**No Face Detected**
- Ensure good lighting when collecting face data
- Try multiple angles and expressions
- Check if face is clearly visible and not obscured

**Poor Recognition Accuracy**
- Collect more training images (10-15 recommended)
- Use Ring doorbell footage for training (more realistic conditions)
- Adjust recognition threshold in `face_recognition.py`

**Audio Issues**
- Check system audio settings and speaker connection
- Verify gTTS and playsound installation
- Test with `python -c "from gtts import gTTS; print('Audio OK')"`
